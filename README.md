## University Student Elections System


</div>

### Description

this is fully usable. all it needs is to get networked so many voters can access it one at a time. i haven't got the time to have it networked now but i 'think' i know how, just have no time. (too much school projects).
 
### More Info
 
i don't know what an INPUT PARAMETER means.

make a new vb project then add all the FORMS and MODULES i have. make the frmMain form the initial form to be runned by the program project. and add the Microsoft Scripting Runtime from the 'References' in the 'Project' menu.

huh? i don't get it.

nothin'. you'll hate yourself coz u didn't think of this first. nah! just joking. no side effects really.
